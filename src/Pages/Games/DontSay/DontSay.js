        This is a very simply game, you will have 3 items we suggest bobby pins
        for the day. If you say the word baby the first person to call you out
        for it gets a point. Person with the most points at the end wins!
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Pick a score keeper at the start and have everyone get bobby pins and
          clip them to their shirt or somewhere visible. Once called out they
          remove a pin or similar item. If you lose all your pins you can't call
          out others!
